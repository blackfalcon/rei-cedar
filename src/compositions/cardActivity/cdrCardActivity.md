While the simple card is a generic wrapper that does not do much more than provide a chome, the activity card is a composition of compomnents and is intended to fill a specific role as outlined. 
 
This Component enhances the behavior of specific presentation parts that are important for this use case, knotice that by providing a title url that the entire card becomes "hot". Note also that this does not alter the tab index of nested elements and remains accessible to screen readers.
