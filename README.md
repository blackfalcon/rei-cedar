REI Cedar Style Framework!
--------------------------

Welcome to REI's style framework! The overall goals of this project are to provide a common scaffolding for UI elements,
and a set of themes that build on this scaffolding. We started this project in 2015 as a fork of
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and have applied many of the concepts from [Semantic-ui](http://semantic-ui.com/).
The project has evolved into what it is today, and will continue to grow to fit our expanding needs. Feel free to watch
the Cedar grow and learn from what we are doing, or jump in and provide some recommendations.

The goal, at this point, is to generate multiple themed CSS resources that different web properties can consume.
In time, we will explore more atomic theming that will allow page creators to mix and match themes: essentially becoming
a theme generator.

This project will work in conjunction with an upcoming component framework that is in the works.  Stay tuned for that!

## Build

To build the CSS bundle, run `gulp`. The built bundle(s) will appear in
`dist/*.css`

## TODO

- Remove generated files from git

## See Also
REI Cedar is a living, working project and will continue to grow, and change. Just like any healthy tree, this one will
lose limbs and may change direction at times.
